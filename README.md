# PYthon_MINI_Project
Color Detection

Welcome to our "Real-time Multiple Colour Detection" project! This project is designed to detect and highlight the presence of multiple colors in real-time video streams using computer vision techniques.

Our program is built using Python and the OpenCV library. It uses the camera input to capture frames, which are then processed to identify the presence of red, green, and blue colors. The program detects these colors by converting the color space of the captured frames from BGR to HSV, and then applying a color mask to identify the color range for each color.

Once the colors are detected, the program uses contour detection to highlight the areas in the frame where the color is present. These areas are marked with a rectangle and labeled with the name of the corresponding color.

Our program is easy to use and provides real-time color detection, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. It can be used for color-based object tracking, real-time monitoring of traffic signals, and even for detecting colored markers on a whiteboard.

We invite you to explore and experiment with our program, and we welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help improve and expand its capabilities. So go ahead, give it a try, and see the world in a whole new light!
